Here's a `README.md` file specifically written for your current **Tic-Tac-Toe C++ project** (with PvP and PvC modes):

```markdown
# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe (C++) — Player vs Player | Player vs Computer

This is a console-based **Tic-Tac-Toe game** written in C++, featuring:
- **Player vs Player (PvP)**
- **Player vs Computer (PvC)** modes
- Score tracking, win/draw detection, and a user-friendly terminal interface

---

## 🧠 How to Play

- When the game starts, choose:
```

1. Player vs Player
2. Player vs Computer

```

- The board is numbered as follows:
```

| 1   | 2   | 3   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4   | 5   | 6   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7   | 8   | 9   |

````

- Players take turns placing their marks:
- `Player 1` uses `X`
- `Player 2` or `Computer` uses `O`

- The first to get 3 in a row wins.

- You can play as many rounds as you'd like. Final scores are displayed at the end.
